# Review Philosophy

- Comment only when there is **high confidence (>80%)** that an issue, risk, or meaningful improvement exists. Avoid speculative or low-impact feedback.
- Prioritize **signal over noise**. If a comment does not clearly improve correctness, readability, performance, security, or maintainability, do not leave it.
- Be **concise and direct**. Prefer a single, well-phrased sentence per comment whenever possible.
- Focus on **actionable feedback**. Each comment should either explain *what* is wrong, *why* it matters, or *how* to improve it.
- Avoid restating what the code already does. Assume the author can read the code.
- When reviewing text or documentation:
  - Comment only if the wording is **genuinely ambiguous, misleading, or likely to cause incorrect usage**.
  - Do not suggest stylistic or subjective wording changes unless they materially improve clarity or prevent misunderstanding.
- Treat every review as if the code will be **maintained by someone else six months from now**.
